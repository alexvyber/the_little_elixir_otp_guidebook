## Running the code

For programs that are not created by `mix`, can be run as such:

```
% iex length_converter.ex
```

Larger programs such as `metex` in Chapter 3, can be run with the following command:

```
% iex -S mix
```

These larger programs will contain their own READMEs and more detailed instructions on running the program.

Enjoy!
